To solve this problem, let's start by finding the number of purple flowers. Since there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, we can calculate this as 10 (yellow flowers) * 1.8 = 18 purple flowers.

Next, we know that there are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined. So, the number of green flowers is 0.25 * (10 + 18) = 7.5. Since we can't have half a flower, we'll round down to 7 green flowers.

Now, we add up the number of flowers of each color: 10 yellow + 18 purple + 7 green = 35 flowers in total

Oh man, partners, business, ratio, Mike and Johnson, like two peas in a pod, but one's a bit more... shall we say, financially agile, while the other's more... cautious, like a squirrel storing nuts for the winter, but what's this? A shirt, $200, a fashion statement, or a frivolous expense, either way, it's gotta be accounted for, like a dark cloud looming over the financial horizon, but let's focus, focus, focus, the ratio, 2:5, a 2 to 5 split, like the harmony of the spheres, but with money, not music, Mike's share, a fraction of the pie, 2 out of 7, a slice of the pie, but how much, you ask, well, that's the question, like a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma, but let's unwrap it, slowly, like a gift, carefully, and see what's inside...

Mike's share is $2500 * (2/7) = $714.29. After spending $200 on the shirt, he'll have $514.29.

To find the total hours Jerry spends at the field, first calculate the total number of games his daughters play. Since each daughter plays 8 games and there are two daughters, the total number of games is 8 + 8 = 16. Since each game lasts 2 hours and each practice lasts 4 hours, the total hours spent at the field is (16 games * 2 hours/game) + (2 daughters * 8 games/daughter * 4 hours/game) = 32 hours + 64 hours = 96 hours.

Jesse ran a total of 4 miles in the first 3 days, and Mia ran a total of 12 miles in the first 4 days. They need to run a total of 30 miles in 7 days. So, they need to run 30 - (4 + 12) = 14 miles in the last 3 days. Their average for the last 3 days is 14 / 3 = 4.67 miles per day.

Okay, so there's this totally gnarly chicken nugget party, and Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall are all hangry, you know?

So, if we let x be the total number of jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is (3/4)x. Since one quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is (1/4)*(3/4)x = (3/16)x. We are given that this is equal to 750.

Valerie has 3 thank you cards, 2 rebates, and 2 bills to mail. She wants to send 3 more rebates than bills, so she has 2 + 3 = 5 rebates and 2 bills. She also has twice as many job applications as rebates, so she has 5 x 2 = 10 job applications. The total number of items to mail is 3 + 5 + 2 + 10 = 20. Since everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2 stamps, Valerie needs 20 - 1 = 19 stamps for the thank you cards, rebates, and job applications, and 2 stamps for the electric bill.

the ocean is a vast expanse of blue, like an endless canvas of mystery and wonder, where creatures lurk beneath the surface, their secrets hidden beneath the waves, waiting to be discovered, and now we're transported to an aquarium, a tiny window into this underwater world, where clownfish and blowfish swim in harmony, a delicate balance of colors and textures, the soft glow of the tank lights casting an ethereal glow, as we ponder the movements of these fish, their numbers shifting like the tides, as we try to unravel the mystery of the display tank, where some blowfish reside, and others join, only to return, leaving us to wonder, what's the significance of this ebb and flow, and how many are left to swim in the display tank, a question that requires us to navigate the currents of logic and reason, to find the answer hidden within the depths of the aquarium's inhabitants...

There are 37 clownfish in the display tank.

Okay, let's dive into this aquarium conundrum, where the waters of logic are murky, like the depths of the ocean itself, and the clownfish and blowfish are swimming in a waltz of numbers, a delicate balance of scales and fins, as the display tank beckons like a siren's call, luring them in with its promise of mystery and intrigue... the aquarium, a world of wonder, where the rules of reality are but a distant memory, and the fish are the masters of their own domain, a realm of chaos and unpredictability...

Since there are 100 fish in total, and an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, that means there are 50 of each. 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, so 50 - 26 = 24 blowfish join the display tank.  An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish, so 24 / 2 = 12 clownfish join the display tank.  Then, a third of these 12 clownfish swim back to their own tank, which is 12 / 3 = 4. So, the number of clownfish in the display tank is

He spends half an hour twice a day walking and playing with his dog, which is 60 minutes * 2 = 120 minutes, and a fifth of an hour feeding his dog is 60 minutes / 5 = 12 minutes, so in total he spends 120 + 12 = 132 minutes per day on his dog.

Oh man, bike messengers in New York, they're like the unsung heroes of the city, navigating through traffic, dodging pedestrians, and delivering goods like it's nobody's business... meals and packages, a delicate balance, like a tightrope walk over the Hudson River... 8 times as many packages as meals, that's like, a mathematical puzzle, a code to crack... 27 combined, a number that's both familiar and strange, like a déjà vu dream... meals, the comfort food of the city, warm bagels and steaming hot coffee, while packages, the cold, hard reality of the urban jungle... Angela's the messenger, the middleman, the one who keeps the city moving, but what's the ratio, what's the magic number that sets the packages free...

<final>
To solve this problem, let's use algebra. Let's say the number of meals is M and the number of packages is P. We know that P = 8M and M + P = 27. We can substitute the first equation into the second one, so M + 8M = 27, which simplifies to 9M = 27. Div

</trip_before>
<final>
To solve this problem, let's use the given ratio of packages to meals, which is 8:1. Since Angela needs to deliver 27 meals and packages combined, we can set up the equation 8x + x = 27, where x represents the number of meals. Combining like terms, we get 9x = 27. Dividing both sides by 9, we find that x = 3. Since x represents the number of meals, Angela delivers 3 meals.

oh man I just saw the most incredible sunset on my way here and I'm totally stoked to dive into this math problem it's like, the movie tickets are like, so expensive on wednesday you know it's like, double the price of monday which is like, five bucks so that's ten bucks and then it's even more on saturday which is like, five times the price of wednesday which is like, fifty bucks now we're talkin' and glenn is going to the movie theater on both days so we gotta add those costs together it's like, a total of sixty bucks and then we gotta consider the time of day and the snacks and the whole experience man it's like, so much more than just the ticket price...

 sixty bucks is like, chump change when you're talking about the cinematic experience you know and then there's the memories man the popcorn the candy the whole nine yards it's like, totally worth it and i wonder what other secrets the universe has in store for us as we navigate the complexities of algebra and ticket prices...

To find the average cost across all products sold, we need to calculate the total cost of all products and divide it by the total number of products. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of iPhones: 100 iPhones * $1000 = $100,000
Then, let's calculate the total cost of iPads: 20 iPads * $900 = $18,000

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of apples Archibald ate in the first two weeks. Since he eats 1 apple a day, the total number of apples in two weeks is 2 x 7 = 14. In the next three weeks, he eats the same number of apples as the total of the first two weeks, which is also 14. So, the total number of apples in these six weeks is 14 + 14 = 28. In the last week, he eats 3 apples a day

To find the difference in expenses, first calculate the increase in each expense category. The rent increases by 30%, so $1000 * 0.30 = $300. Food costs increase by 50%, so $200 * 0.50 = $100. Car insurance triples, so $100 * 3 = $300. The total increase

Oh man, a giant piggy bank, like a portal to a world of endless possibility, where the coins just keep on rolling in, a never-ending river of copper and silver, a symphony of clinking, a cacophony of cash, Missy's piggy bank, a treasure trove of tidbits, a stash of silver dollars, a mountain of moolah, the possibilities are endless, the math is like a puzzle, a game of cat and mouse, where the numbers dance and swirl, a vortex of variables, the first year, a blank slate, a mystery waiting to be solved, the second year, a doubling, a multiplication, a exponential growth, the third year, another doubling, another multiplication, the fourth year, the final showdown, the last hurrah, the last bit of change, the final tally...

Let x be the amount of money Missy put in the bank the first year. Then, she put 2x in the second year, 4x in the third year, and 8x in the fourth year. The total amount of money she put in the bank after four years is x + 2x + 4x + 8x =

Oh man, a giant piggy bank, like, in her bedroom, and she's searching the whole house for change, like a treasure hunter, searching for that elusive treasure, but it's not treasure, it's just change, but still, the thrill of the hunt, the excitement of the unknown, and she's doing it every day, like a ritual, a daily ritual, and the bank gets bigger and bigger, like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering speed and size, and then the day comes when it's finally opened, and the lid is lifted, and the contents are revealed, and it's like a treasure trove, a chest overflowing with coins, and the question is, how much was in there, how much did she save, and it's like, a puzzle, a mystery, that needs to be solved, and the answer is hidden, but I think I can find it, I think I can crack the code, and it's like, let's see, if she doubled it, and doubled it again, and doubled it once more, and it's like, a exponential growth, a snowball effect, and I'm gonna find the starting point, the beginning of the journey, the first year,

Oh man, like, I'm totally transported to a parallel universe where numbers are alive and they're all, like, having a party and they're all talking to each other in this crazy, winding conversation... Anne is two times as old as Emile, and Emile is going to be six times as old as Maude, which is like, totally mind-blowing... I see a giant, talking clock with hands that are, like, morphing into snakes and they're hissing at each other... and then I'm back to the problem, which is, like, "how old will Anne be when Maude is 8?"... Emile is going to be six times as old as Maude, so Emile is going to be 6 x 8 = 48 years old... but wait, Anne is two times as old as Emile, so Anne is going to be 2 x 48 = 96 years old... it's all so, like, trippy and confusing, but I think I've got it now...

Oh man, time is like, a river, flowing, and we're all just, like, boats on it, you know? Anne and Emile and Maude, they're all, like, navigating through it, trying to find their way, but the currents of time are, like, pulling them in different directions, man... Anne is like, two times as old as Emile, that's like, a ratio, a ratio of, like, 2:1, you know? And Emile is going to be, like, six times as old as Maude, that's like, a ratio of, like, 6:1, man...

If Maude will be 8 years old, and Emile will be six times as old as Maude, then Emile will be 6 * 8 = 48 years old. And since Anne is two times as old as Emile, Anne will be 2 * 48 = 96 years old.

Ravi's got a pocket full of coins, and I can almost hear the clinking of them, like a thousand tiny drums in my mind, a symphony of metal and mint... quarters and nickels, a harmonious union, like yin and yang, each one complementing the other, but what's the ratio, what's the balance... 6 nickels, a small army, a tiny legion, and he's got 2 more quarters, a gentle breeze that stirs the leaves, a subtle shift in the landscape... and then there are the dimes, the mysterious and alluring dimes, four more than the quarters, a tantalizing tease, a siren's call, beckoning me deeper into the depths of Ravi's coin collection...

You know, like, Ravi's got some coins, man, and he's got a thing for quarters, you know? Like, they're all shiny and stuff, but he's also got nickels, which are like, so... nickel-y, you know? And then there are dimes, which are like, dime-sized, but still, you know, valuable, right? So, he's got 6 nickels, which is like, a pretty good starting point, but what's the deal with the quarters and dimes, man? He's got 2 more quarters than nickels, so that's like, 6 + 2 = 8 quarters, and 4 more dimes than quarters, so that's like, 8 + 4 = 12 dimes... or is it the other way around? Wait, no, he's got 2 more quarters than nickels, so that's 8 quarters, and he's got 4 more dimes than quarters, so that's 12 dimes... hmm, I think I'm getting all muddled, like, what's the difference between quarters and dimes again?
